<hr><center><h2>WiFi thermostat - ESP8266 / ESP32</h2></center><hr>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The software implementation is designed for microcontroller platforms from the manufacturer Espressif Systems with WiFi connectivity.
Specifically, the ESP8266 microcontroller in versions 12E to F used in the Wemos D1 Mini, NodeMCU v2, v3 platforms.
<b> ESP8266-01 / ESP8266-01S microcontrollers and similar standalone chips before the 12E generation are not compatible for the project in terms of program recording, as they do not use the DIO flash method, for which ESPTOOL calls are designed in the project; upload firmware to these devices as well. </b>
For the ESP32 microcontroller, it is possible to use standalone chips ESP32-WROOM-32 from Espressif and the equivalent ESP-32S from AI-Thinker.
All DevKits included with these chips are also compatible, they are fully compatible (for example DevKit v1 / DevKiTC-v4).
WiFi thermostat is accessible from the LAN network in which it is located, while it is equipped with a web interface that is used to configure all elements of the thermostat.
The thermostat controls the boiler based on the measured, target temperature and hysteresis independently of the web application, which serves for the configuration and decision threshold of the thermostat.
In addition to the availability of the thermostat at a specific IP address, the thermostat can be supplemented with an mDNS record, which generates a local domain (hostname.local) accessible only in the LAN network within this multicast service.
The configuration of the thermostat (from the point of view of connectivity) on the home WiFi LAN network is secured by WiFiManager, which stores data about the WiFi network (SSID and password) in the flash memory of the microcontroller.
The storage is one-time and the device remembers the configuration permanently. After gaining connectivity (assigning an IP address from the router of your home WiFi network), the thermostat can be fully used.
The HTTP web server running on the ESP8266 / ESP32 microcontroller allows the running of several independent HTML pages, which can be informative or even functional.
</p>
<b>In terms of hardware, the project uses:</b>
<li>ESP8266 / ESP32</li>
<li>DS18B20 temperature sensor on the OneWire bus</li>
<li>Relay SRD-5VDC-SL-C / OMRON G3MB-202P used for boiler switching (Active-LOW signal)</li>
<b>HTML pages running on ESP8266 / ESP32 platform:</b>
<li><b>/</b> - root page containing form, current logic output for relay, current and target temperature, hysteresis</li>
<li><b>/action.html</b> - processes values from the form, writes them to the emulated EEPROM memory, redirects the user back to the root page</li>
<li><b>/get_data.json</b> - distributes data on current temperature, reference temperature and hysteresis to a third party (computer, microcontroller, other client ...) in JSON format - can be used with an example JSON client that can send data to MQTT Broker, for example to home automation</li>
<li>and other system subpages to control the output, change the mode</li>
<hr>	
<p style="text-align: justify;">		
<b>The resolution of the DS18B20 sensor during measurement is 12-bits, which is indicated by the resolution at 0.0625 ° C. Data via the OneWire bus can be returned to the microcontroller on demand in 500 to 1000 ms.</b>	
The electromagnetic relay SRD-5VDC-SL-C, which is used in the project, allows switching up to 10A at 230V - power 2300W.
In case of switching a DC circuit (load) it is possible to switch 300W (10A at 30V DC).
Alternatively, the OMRON G3MB-202P SSR relay is fully compatible for the wiring diagram, which is only suitable for non-inductive loads and exclusively for AC circuits.
Maximum switching power 460W (230V, 2A). <b> The thermostat can be used all year round. In case of unnecessary control, it is possible to physically disconnect the output and use the thermostat as a WiFi thermometer to obtain data from the room where it is located. </b>
The thermostat logic is executed every 10 seconds independently of the web server and connected clients, no keep-alive connection is required to execute it.
Each time the logic is executed, the thermostat also writes information about the current IP address or mDNS record (if used with mDNS firmware) on the UART thermostat and thus gives the user information on where the thermostat is accessible with its web interface in the LAN network.
In addition, it also lists the dynamic free memory - HEAP, which is at the level of 40 to 44kB, as well as the current state of the output with notification of the change if it occurs -> (if the decision threshold flows to + or to -).
<b>The 3V3 GPIO operating logic of the ESP8266 and ESP32 microcontrollers is sufficient for a digital change signal, but the relay must be powered to 5V from the VUSB and VIN, respectively.</b>
</p>

<b>Web interface for WiFi thermostat allows:</b>
<li>View in real time the temperature from the DS18B20 sensor, the device uptime, the output value with dynamic change, the currently set configuration data for the thermostat, i. target temperature and hysteresis</li>
<li>Modify the target (reference) temperature <del>in the range of 5 to 50 °C with a 0.25 °C step</del><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zMsp0cr.png" width="20px" height="20px" data-toggle="tooltip2" data-placement="right" title="Scope removed in version 1.0.2 due to non-decimal point support for input type number on Android OS"></li>
<li>Modify hysteresis <del>in the range of 0 to 10 °C with a 0.25 °C step</del><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zMsp0cr.png" width="20px" height="20px" data-toggle="tooltip2" data-placement="right" title="Scope removed in version 1.0.2 due to non-decimal point support for input type number on Android OS"></li>

  <strong>Program implementation of a thermostat with automatic mode is experimental!</strong>
</div>
<b>Boiler ON / OFF control - automatic mode:</b> 
<li>Example ON / OFF of heating control - <font color="red">VISUALIZATION IS NOT PART OF THE PROJECT</font></li>	
<li>The boiler is active until the target temperature + hysteresis is reached</li>
<li>The visualization of water temperatures shows the so-called heating run-up and subsequent cooling of the water until the heating activity is repeated, when the measured temperature is below the set target temperature - hysteresis</li>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<b>A manual control mode (hard ON / OFF) has been implemented in the basic version of the WiFi thermostat (without mDNS recording) with the possibility of switching between manual and automatic mode. </b>
The web interface is designed to adapt to larger and smaller screens. It is responsive, supporting widescreen high-definition screens as well as mobile devices.
The interface uses imported CSS styles of the Bootstrap framework from an external CDN server, which loads the client-side device when opening a page running on ESP.
By importing CSS styles from an external server, it will reduce the power and memory load of the microcontroller.
</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In order to keep the set values of the thermostat even after a power failure, they are stored in the EEPROM memory ESP, which is emulated in the flash memory, as the platform does not have a physical EEPROM chip (memory).
Reference temperature to offset 10, hysteresis to offset 100. Each of the values occupies a maximum of 5B in the EEPROM memory + the end character.
The data is overwritten only when the HTML form is sent, so the operation of the thermostat is as gentle as possible to the EEPROM memory for its maximum durability.
The output state exists only in RAM memory, it is not stored in flash memory.
If the device does not have anything stored on the mentioned EEPROM offsets at the first start-up, automatic writing will be performed with default values - reference: 20.25 °C, hysteresis 0.00 °C, so-called fail-safe solution.
ESP8266 and ESP32 use the EEPROM.put() function in conjunction with EEPROM.commit() to work with EEPROM memory and EEPROM.get() to read data from EEPROM, which supports any data type, in our case float().
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Using the Refresh meta tag, the web server refreshes the entire page every 30 seconds, and the approximate time to refresh is also written to the HTML page via Javascript.
By this time it is necessary to write the change for the thermostat, otherwise the input windows for numerical inputs to the form will be reset when the page is refreshed.
As the built-in Ethernet library does not include the use of an asynchronous web server (which can be used, for example, with the Espressif ESP8266 / ESP32 microcontrollers), it is necessary to rewrite the entire page.
</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The dynamic data that is mainly changing is the current value of the output - <b><font color="#27AE60">Turned on</font></b> / <b><font color="red">Turned off</font></b>, which informs the operator about the actual state of the output together with the color coding. 
Since the system logic is executed independently of the web server, the output may already be in a different state than currently currently listed in the web application. The change of output is immediately written to the UART monitor, for example.
On the thermostat's website, the user will also find information about the device's uptime (how long it has been running), i. time in days, hours, minutes and seconds. <b> The thermostat is only intended for indoor temperatures! </b> (above 0 ° C), to which the system logic is adapted!
The thermostat can replace an existing room thermostat, it can temporarily replace the heater in the aquarium / terrarium to maintain a constant temperature.
